This mod adds [b]Near-Earth Objects[/b] like moons, asteroids, space debris, and artificial-satellites that has to be launched into orbit. Everything is [b]visible[/b] and [b]animated[/b] as an orbit on the world map mode. The moons are playable biomes that needs to be discovered.

The rocket to the left is a [b]satellite[/b] that you can launch into orbit. This will be visible in the world map and is required to find moons. The amount of satellites you have also increases the chance of finding mineral rich asteroids in orbit. The middle rocket is the [b]space station[/b] that you can launch into orbit, and it will generate a map with a simple starter station. The right most rocket is a [b]cargo transport pod[/b] and can carry more weight. Useful for asteroid mining.

Because of how the fuelling station spot gets placed, I had to make the actual size of the launchpad different then the texture which makes this process a bit awkward. To select the launchpad you will need to click one tile to the left of the middle (double click if you only get the transport pod). This is where you fuel up the transport pods.

To [b]discover moons[/b], you are required to have two satellites in orbit. Once you have that you can use the [b]satellite dish[/b] to communicate with the satellites to find a moon orbiting the planet.

Mineral-rich asteroids will randomly show up in the asteroid belt for a limited time. Send up a colonist to harvest the asteroids. The number of artificial satellites orbiting the planet will increase the chance of spotting these mineral-rich asteroids.

The spacesuit is perfect for your colonist to explore outer space. It has high heat and cold resistance with complete toxic radiation resistance.

[h2]Performance[/h2]
The only impact this mod has on performance is on the world map. If it lags for you, I recommend using My Little Planet to generate smaller planets. I have also added settings where you can change the amount of satellite objects you want to spawn (asteroid belt). This, however, requires a new save.

[h2]FAQ[/h2]
[quote]
[b]Is this mod save game compatible?[/b]

Yes, but to see the asteroids you need to go into developer mode -> world map -> debug actions, and press the [i]RimNauts2: Regenerate satellites[/i]
[/quote]

[b]Can this mod be safely removed from a save?[/b]

Abandon any map that you have generated on a satellite (moons). Go into developer mode and click on each moon, satellite, and space station that you have spawned and click destroy. Go into mod settings and set the total amount of satellite objects to 0. Regenerate satellite objects (developer mode -> world map -> debug actions, and press the RimNauts2: Regenerate satellites). Make sure that the last log message says that the total satellite objects are 0.

[b]The satellite / space station doesn't launch.[/b]

This is because you need asteroids on the world map. You can either try it in a new save, or generate the asteroids in your save game by going into developer mode -> world map -> debug actions, and press the [i]RimNauts2: Regenerate satellites[/i]

[b]I can't find the buildings, where are they?[/b]

Everything is locked behind the [b]Transport Pod research[/b].

[quote]
[b]Can we get a light version?[/b]

No, if you just want the asteroid belt animation, you can just not use the other parts of the mod.
[/quote]
[quote]
[b]What is the point of the moons?[/b]

Mostly for role-play, but there is also asteroid mining which requires you to travel from orbit (moon base, space station). It is also a lot better on performance since there are no animals in new biomes.

[b]There is oxygen on the moon!?[/b]

Yes, you need SOS2 to get oxygen system implemented. I have patched it so you just need SOS2 loaded for it to work.
I am also working on my own oxygen system, but it takes time to get it right.

[quote]
[b]Can we get reusable ships?[/b]

Use SRTS or Vehicles Framework.
[/quote]
[quote]
[b]Should I use RimNauts 1 together with RimNauts 2?[/b]

No.
[/quote]
[quote]
[b]I have tried following the save game compatible step provided above in the FAQ and I'm still getting the wrong maps. What can I do?[/b]

It is sadly something out of my ability to fix. Users have reported the only fix is to start a new game. If you want to remove the mod from the game, follow the 'how to safely remove this mod from save game' provided above under FAQ first.
