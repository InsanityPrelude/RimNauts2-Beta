This mod adds [b]Near-Earth Objects[/b] like moons, asteroids, space debris, and artificial-satellites. Everything is [b]visible[/b] and [b]animated[/b] as an orbit on the world map. The moons are playable biomes that needs to be discovered and the artifical satellites needs to be launched into orbit.

The rocket to the left is a [b]satellite[/b] that you can launch into orbit. This will be visible in the world map and is required to find moons. The amount of satellites you have also increases the chance of finding mineral rich asteroids in orbit. The middle rocket is the [b]space station[/b] that you can launch into orbit, and it will generate a map with a simple starter station. The right most rocket is a [b]cargo transport pod[/b] and can carry more weight. Useful for asteroid mining.

To [b]discover moons[/b], you are required to have two satellites in orbit. Once you have that you can use the [b]satellite dish[/b] to communicate with the satellites to find a moon orbiting the planet.

Mineral-rich asteroids will randomly show up in the asteroid belt for a limited time. Send up a colonist to harvest the asteroids. The number of artificial satellites orbiting the planet will increase the chance of spotting these mineral-rich asteroids.

The only impact this mod has on performance is on the world map. If it lags for you, I recommend using My Little Planet to generate smaller planets. I have also added settings where you can change the amount of satellite objects you want to spawn (asteroid belt). This, however, requires you to [url=https://github.com/RimNauts/RimNauts2/blob/main/Workshop/Guides/regenerate-satellites.md]regenerate satellites.[/url]

[b]Is this mod save game compatible?[/b]

Yes, but to see the asteroids you need to [url=https://github.com/RimNauts/RimNauts2/blob/main/Workshop/Guides/regenerate-satellites.md]regenerate satellites.[/url]

[b]Can this mod be safely removed from a save?[/b]

Abandon any map that you have generated on a satellite (moons). Go into god mode (developer mode -> the little head icon at the top middle screen when looking at a map) and click on each moon, satellite, and space station that you have spawned and click destroy. Go into mod settings and set the total amount of satellite objects to 0. Then you need to [url=https://github.com/RimNauts/RimNauts2/blob/main/Workshop/Guides/regenerate-satellites.md]regenerate satellites.[/url] Make sure that the last log message says that the total satellite objects are 0.

[b]The satellite / space station doesn't launch.[/b]

This is because you need asteroids on the world map. You can either try it in a new save, or [url=https://github.com/RimNauts/RimNauts2/blob/main/Workshop/Guides/regenerate-satellites.md]regenerate satellites.[/url]

[b]I can't find the buildings, where are they?[/b]

Everything is locked behind the [b]Transport Pod research[/b].

[b]Can we get a light version?[/b]

No, if you just want the asteroid belt animation, you can just not use the other parts of the mod.

[b]What is the point of the moons?[/b]

Mostly for role-play, but there is also asteroid mining which requires you to travel from orbit (moon base, space station). It is also a lot better on performance since there are no animals in new biomes.

[b]Can we get reusable ships?[/b]

Use SRTS or Vehicles Framework.

[b]Should I use RimNauts 1 together with RimNauts 2?[/b]

No.

[b]Is it CE compatible?[/b]

Yes.
